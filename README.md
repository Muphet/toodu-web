## Toodu Web

Toodu Web is the frontend for [Toodu API](https://github.com/bhnywl/toodu-api).

It is a Progressive Web App for collaborative task management, built in React using my custom [fork of create-react-app](https://github.com/bhnywl/create-react-app). A live demo can be found [here](https://toodu.surge.sh).

Note. The API is hosted on a free Heroku dyno so can be slow to spin up.
